# Getting started

> On this page, you'll find general information about stocked.

## Motivation

If you need to share state between your components, you'll face the performance issue. Saving all your app state into context isn't good solution, because changing value causes whole app rerender.

`stocked` adds a little functionality for handling global state. Changing this state not rerenders all your app, it rerenders only components, which use it.

:::tip Pro tip!

You can highlight updates when component render with [React developer tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=ru).
